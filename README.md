# rpistudio
A skeleton to control scientific experiments using the Raspberry PI

Currently, _rpistudio_ has only a main function: being a good tool to perform a scientific experiment I'm involved in. It is a set of python scripts that run on the Raspberry PI and control experiments. In particular, _rpistudio_ is responsible for maintaining costant a temperature inside an enclosure (using a Peltier cell and an H-bridge) and measuring some ambient parameters.

After some refactoring and a bit of work, I plan to generalize some of its functions, in order to allow an easier user by other interested people (if any).

## Planned TODO

* Using a sensor (analog or digital) will correspond to istantiate an opportune class (_in progress_)
* Setup a web application to launch and control the experiments
